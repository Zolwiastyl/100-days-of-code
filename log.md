### Day 0: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Just learned the basics of useState Hook, and components embeding.

**Thoughts:** I spend to much time for just reading tutorials and docs instead of
trying to code something even in very brute way, whereas the second approach gave much better results.

### Day 1: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Get more fluent in passing props down the components, got some fun styling text with CSS.

**Thoughts:** As yesterday I wish I would start coding more instead of reading earlier. I felt like having a grate brakethrough just by understanding rules of passing props in React.

### Day 2: March 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I refreshed and practised my HTML skills using excercices from freecodecamp.org that can be found at:
Responsive Web Design Certificate / Basic HTML and HTML5

**Thoughts:** I have to get equilibrium in learning new and a little bit more complicated stuff like React and in doing some basic drills like working with HTML and CSS to feel more comfortable while working with it beacuse even writting JSX involves both of them.
