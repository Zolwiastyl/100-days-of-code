##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress:** Just learned the basics of useState Hook, and components embeding.

**Thoughts:** I spend to much time for just reading tutorials and docs instead of
trying to code something even in very brute way, whereas the second approach gave much better results.
