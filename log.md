**Today's Progress:** Just learned the basics of useState Hook, and components embeding.

### Day 1: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Get more fluent in passing props down the components, got some fun styling text with CSS.

**Thoughts:** As yesterday I wish I would start coding more instead of reading earlier. I felt like having a grate brakethrough just by understanding rules of passing props in React.
