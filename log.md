### Day 0: March 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

**Thoughts:**

**Link to work:** []()

### Day 0: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Just learned the basics of useState Hook, and components embeding.

**Thoughts:** I spend to much time for just reading tutorials and docs instead of
trying to code something even in very brute way, whereas the second approach gave much better results.

### Day 1: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Get more fluent in passing props down the components, got some fun styling text with CSS.

**Thoughts:** As yesterday I wish I would start coding more instead of reading earlier. I felt like having a grate brakethrough just by understanding rules of passing props in React.

### Day 2: March 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I refreshed and practised my HTML skills using excercices from freecodecamp.org that can be found at:
Responsive Web Design Certificate / Basic HTML and HTML5

**Thoughts:** I have to get equilibrium in learning new and a little bit more complicated stuff like React and in doing some basic drills like working with HTML and CSS to feel more comfortable while working with it beacuse even writting JSX involves both of them.

### Day 3: March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started doing excercises on functional programming from freecodecamp.org. Hit a wall at one point after while of coding. Going to get back to it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** It's just going further.

### Day 4: March 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've implemented prototype.myMap during freecodecamp.org course and done some excercises involving code refactoring.

**Thoughts:** Really, a lot of writting every day is the right key to programming.

### Day 5: March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Met .reduce for the first time. That was quite hard until i tried to write it.

**Thoughts:** To be able to keep track of my progress and to see in a while how my coding skills improved or style changed I will make separate folder for each day, within I will include code downloaded from excercises made on freecodecamp.org. It will be in .txt because that's the default file format from the website.

### Day 6: March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've get to know what currying is and finally how to use spread operator, used .sort with my own sort function.

**Thoughts:** I think this should be the last day of me coding just for coding I will need to start building a project.
